## IATI Data Dump (frontend)

#### A daily snapshot of all IATI data (and metadata) on the IATI registry.

[Download all IATI data](https://iati-data-dump.codeforiati.org/)

#### Rationale

Lots of IATI products do a daily pull of all IATI XML data. That involves downloading gigabytes of data, via thousands of HTTP requests. So it’s quite slow.

Downloading a single archive file is significantly faster. That’s available here!

#### How does this work?
